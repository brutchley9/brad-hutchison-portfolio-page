# Brad Hutchison Portfolio Page

This application was created in an effort to showcase my projects in web development by creating my own website from scratch, with basic HTML, a CSS stylesheet, and more. This was accomplished by:

<li>Utilizing attached resource pages, such as W3 Schools and Stack Overflow, to research how to properly organize a webpage</li>

<li>"Reverse-engineering" code while implementing it (in order to better understand its function between CSS and HTML pages), and...</li>

<li>Plenty of trial and error</li>
